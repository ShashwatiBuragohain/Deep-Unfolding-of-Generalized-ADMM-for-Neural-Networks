# Deep-Unfolding-of-Generalized-ADMM-for-Neural-Networks
Developing a deep-unfolded MIMO detector by mapping the iterative steps of the Generalized ADMM optimization algorithm into trainable neural network layers to enable efficient symbol detection in wireless systems, while analyzing the impact of trainable parameter count on detection performance.
